Universal UI/UX Design System for DailyFitness
Based on Top Fitness Apps (Peloton, Strava, Nike Training Club, Apple Fitness+, Strong, Fitbod)

🎨 CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES TO APPLY EVERYWHERE
1. Visual Hierarchy Through Scale & Contrast
Problem: Your app treats all information equally - numbers, labels, icons all similar in weight.
Top Apps Solution: Dramatic scale differences create instant scanability.
TYPOGRAPHY SCALE SYSTEM:

Hero Numbers (Main Metrics):
- Size: 48-64pt (SF Pro Rounded)
- Weight: Bold/Heavy
- Usage: Streak count, calories, workout count
- Example: "7" (day streak) should be 3x larger

Supporting Numbers (Secondary Metrics):
- Size: 28-34pt (SF Pro Rounded)
- Weight: Semibold
- Usage: Progress percentages, rankings

Labels (Context):
- Size: 13-15pt (SF Pro Text)
- Weight: Regular/Medium
- Color: 60% opacity
- Usage: "Day Streak", "This Month"

Body Text:
- Size: 15-17pt (SF Pro Text)
- Weight: Regular
- Line height: 1.4-1.5
```

**Apply This:**
- Every card should have ONE dominant element (usually a number)
- Labels should be 1/3 the size of the number
- Create visual rhythm: Big → Small → Big → Small
- Use SF Pro Rounded for all numbers (friendlier, more fitness-focused)
- Use SF Pro Text for all labels and body copy

---

### 2. **Motion Design Language**

**Problem:** Static interface with no feedback or personality.

**Top Apps Solution:** Every interaction has a signature animation style.
```
ANIMATION DNA:

Page Transitions:
- Duration: 350ms
- Easing: Custom bezier (0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)
- Style: Slide with momentum, slight scale
- Never: Linear or instant cuts

Button Presses:
- Scale down: 0.94 (60ms, ease-out)
- Hold: Maintain scale
- Release: Spring back (180ms, spring damping 0.7)
- Haptic: Medium impact on press

Number Animations:
- Count up from 0 (or previous value)
- Duration: 800-1200ms based on magnitude
- Easing: Ease-out
- Add subtle "bounce" at end (spring)
- Decimal precision matches data type

Card Interactions:
- Hover/Press: Lift shadow, subtle scale (1.02)
- Dismiss: Slide + fade (300ms)
- Appear: Staggered fade-up (100ms delay between cards)

Loading States:
- Skeleton shimmer: 1400ms loop
- Shimmer angle: -20 degrees
- Colors: Background → 10% lighter → Background
- Never: Spinners for content loads
```

**Universal Rules:**
- NO instant state changes (always animate)
- Spring physics for natural feel (not ease-in-out)
- Haptic feedback for ALL taps (except scrolling)
- Exit animations should be 20% faster than entry
- Loading states should MORPH into content (not replace)

---

### 3. **Color System with Semantic Meaning**

**Problem:** Purple/blue for everything lacks emotion and context.

**Top Apps Solution:** Color = emotion + information + hierarchy.
```
SEMANTIC COLOR PALETTE:

Energy/Action (Start, Active, High Intensity):
Primary: #FF6B35 (Sunset Orange)
Light: #FF8A5B
Dark: #E55325
Gradient: 135deg, #FF6B35 → #FF4E50
Use: Start buttons, active states, HIIT workouts, calories burned
Emotion: Energy, urgency, excitement

Trust/Progress (Secondary Actions, Stats):
Primary: #4A90E2 (Sky Blue)
Light: #5CA0F2
Dark: #3A7BC8
Gradient: 135deg, #4A90E2 → #357ABD
Use: Browse, schedule, strength workouts, time-based metrics
Emotion: Reliability, calm confidence

Success/Achievement (Completed, Goals Met):
Primary: #7CB342 (Growth Green)
Light: #9CCC65
Dark: #689F38
Gradient: 135deg, #7CB342 → #558B2F
Use: Checkmarks, completed items, positive trends, recovery
Emotion: Accomplishment, health, growth

Warning/Intensity (High effort, alerts):
Primary: #FFA726 (Alert Amber)
Light: #FFB74D
Dark: #FB8C00
Gradient: 135deg, #FFA726 → #FF9800
Use: Intensity warnings, streaks at risk, moderate priority
Emotion: Attention, warmth, caution

Critical/Peak (Max effort, urgent):
Primary: #E53935 (Power Red)
Light: #EF5350
Dark: #C62828
Gradient: 135deg, #E53935 → #D32F2F
Use: Peak zones, errors, streak broken, max intensity
Emotion: Power, intensity, urgency

Neutral/Inactive:
Primary: #9E9E9E (Stone Gray)
Light: #BDBDBD
Dark: #757575
Use: Inactive states, disabled buttons, future items
Emotion: Rest, pending, neutral

Background System:
Light Mode:
  - Primary: #FFFFFF
  - Secondary: #F5F7FA (slight blue tint)
  - Tertiary: #EBEBF0
  
Dark Mode:
  - Primary: #000000 (true black for OLED)
  - Secondary: #1C1C1E
  - Tertiary: #2C2C2E
```

**Application Rules:**
1. **Card Backgrounds MUST have colored borders/gradients** based on content type
2. **Icons should inherit semantic colors** (not all gray)
3. **Progress indicators use gradient fills** (not solid colors)
4. **Text on colored backgrounds needs 4.5:1 contrast minimum**
5. **Dark mode colors should be 15-20% lighter** than light mode equivalents

---

### 4. **Depth & Layering System**

**Problem:** Flat cards on flat background = boring, no hierarchy.

**Top Apps Solution:** Strategic elevation creates focus and premium feel.
```
ELEVATION LEVELS:

Level 0 (Background):
- Z-index: 0
- Shadow: None
- Color: Background color
- Use: App background, behind all content

Level 1 (Surface - Resting Cards):
- Z-index: 1
- Shadow: 0px 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
- Border: 0.5px rgba(0,0,0,0.04) (optional)
- Corner radius: 16pt
- Use: Default card state, list items

Level 2 (Raised - Important Cards):
- Z-index: 2
- Shadow: 0px 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)
- Border: None
- Corner radius: 20pt
- Use: Hero cards, today's workout, streak display

Level 3 (Floating - Interactive):
- Z-index: 3
- Shadow: 0px 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.16)
- Scale: 1.02
- Corner radius: 20pt
- Use: Pressed cards, dragging, FAB

Level 4 (Modal/Overlay):
- Z-index: 100
- Shadow: 0px 16px 48px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)
- Backdrop blur: 20pt
- Corner radius: 24pt (top corners only for bottom sheets)
- Use: Modals, bottom sheets, alerts

Gradient Overlays:
- Subtle gradient on all cards: 0 → 2% white overlay
- Direction: 135deg (top-left to bottom-right)
- Creates depth and premium feel
- More pronounced in dark mode
```

**Universal Rules:**
- Cards should NEVER be flat against background (always shadow)
- Active/pressed states should visibly lift (increase shadow + scale)
- Overlapping content = higher z-index ALWAYS has more shadow
- Bottom sheets should blur background content
- Shadows should be colored (slight tint of primary color) not pure black

---

### 5. **Spacing & Layout Grid**

**Problem:** Inconsistent padding and margins throughout.

**Top Apps Solution:** Mathematical spacing system for rhythm.
```
8PT GRID SYSTEM:

Screen Margins:
- Horizontal: 20pt (iPhone), 24pt (iPad)
- Top safe area: 8pt below safe area
- Bottom safe area: 16pt above safe area + tab bar

Card Padding:
- External margin: 16pt between cards vertically
- Horizontal: 16pt from screen edge
- Internal padding: 20pt all sides
- Content to edge of card: 20pt minimum

Stack Spacing (Vertical):
- Micro (related items): 8pt
- Small (grouped content): 12pt
- Medium (sections within card): 20pt
- Large (separate sections): 32pt
- XLarge (major sections): 48pt

Horizontal Spacing:
- Icon to label: 12pt
- Button to button: 16pt
- Card to card (horizontal scroll): 16pt

Touch Targets:
- Minimum: 44x44pt (Apple HIG)
- Preferred: 48x48pt
- Comfortable: 56x56pt
- Use padding to expand hit area without expanding visual size

Grid Columns:
- 12 column grid for complex layouts
- 8pt gutter between columns
- Snap all elements to grid
```

**Apply Everywhere:**
- ALL measurements should be divisible by 4 (ideally by 8)
- Consistency > Perfection (16pt everywhere is better than 14pt/16pt/18pt mix)
- White space is a feature, not wasted space
- Dense information should still breathe (20pt minimum padding)

**Problem:** Users don't know what's happening (loading, success, error).

**Solution:** Every state should have clear, branded visual feedback.
```
STATE DESIGN SYSTEM:

1. LOADING (Skeleton Screens):

## 📐 RESPONSIVE & ADAPTIVE DESIGN

**Problem:** Same layout for all screen sizes and contexts.

**Solution:** Adapt to device, orientation, and content.
```
BREAKPOINT SYSTEM:

iPhone SE (Small):
- Compact mode: Fewer cards visible
- Simplified navigation labels (icons only)
- Condensed metrics
- Priority content only above fold

iPhone Pro (Standard):
- Default layouts
- Full navigation labels
- All metrics visible
- Balanced density

iPhone Pro Max (Large):
- More content per screen
- Side-by-side cards where appropriate
- Expanded metrics with trends
- Premium spacing

iPad (Tablet):
- 2-column layouts
- Sidebar navigation
- Floating panels
- Desktop-class density

ORIENTATION ADAPTATION:

Portrait (Default):
- Vertical scrolling primary
- Stacked cards
- Full-width elements
- Tab bar at bottom

Landscape:
- Horizontal emphasis
- Side-by-side content
- Collapsed headers
- Compact navigation
- More information visible
```

---

## 🎵 SOUND DESIGN (Optional but Powerful)

**Problem:** Silent interactions feel lifeless.

**Solution:** Subtle audio feedback reinforces actions.
```
SOUND LIBRARY:

UI Sounds (Subtle, < 0.3s):
- Button tap: Soft click (50ms)
- Toggle switch: Tactile flip (100ms)
- Modal open: Whoosh up (200ms)
- Modal close: Whoosh down (200ms)
- Pull refresh: Wind-up (300ms)

Success Sounds (Satisfying, < 0.5s):
- Workout logged: Chime (200ms)
- Goal met: Bell (300ms)
- Streak continued: Fire crackle (250ms)
- Achievement unlock: Fanfare (500ms)

Warning Sounds (Gentle, < 0.3s):
- Error: Bump (150ms)
- Warning: Soft alert (200ms)
- Streak at risk: Urgent pulse (250ms)

Celebration Sounds (Fun, < 1s):
- Workout complete: Celebration (800ms)
- New PR: Triumph (1000ms)
- Milestone: Orchestral hit (700ms)
- Level up: Ascending chime (900ms)

Guidelines:
- ALL sounds are off by default
- User opts in via settings
- Volume respects system level
- Haptic feedback is ALWAYS on (unless disabled system-wide)
- Never: Repetitive or annoying sounds
- Each sound is unique to its action
```

## ✨ MICRO-COPY PRINCIPLES

**Problem:** Generic, corporate language everywhere.

**Solution:** Personality, motivation, and clarity in every word.
```
VOICE & TONE:

DailyFitness Personality:
- Supportive coach, not drill sergeant
- Celebrates wins, encourages on setbacks
- Confident but humble
- Uses "you" and "your" (personal)
- Avoids jargon, uses simple language
- Emoji-friendly but not overdone

COPY PATTERNS:

Buttons:
❌ "Submit"
✅ "Start Workout"

❌ "OK"
✅ "Got it!"

❌ "Cancel"
✅ "Not now"

Empty States:
❌ "No data available"
✅ "Let's create your first workout"

❌ "0 items"
✅ "Your journey starts here"

Errors:
❌ "Error 404"
✅ "We couldn't find that workout"

❌ "Invalid input"
✅ "Hmm, let's try that again"

Success:
❌ "Operation successful"
✅ "Awesome! Workout saved"

❌ "Complete"
✅ "You crushed it! 💪"

Loading:
❌ "Loading..."
✅ "Preparing your workout..."

❌ "Please wait"
✅ "Almost ready..."

Notifications:
❌ "Reminder: Task due"
✅ "Time to crush today's workout!"

❌ "Update available"
✅ "New features are here! 🎉"

Encouragement (Context-aware):
- Morning: "Let's start strong today!"
- Afternoon: "Keep the momentum going!"
- Evening: "Finish the day with a workout!"
- Streak Day 7: "Amazing! Full week complete!"
- Missed Day: "No worries - let's get back on track!"
- PR Day: "New record! You're getting stronger!"

🎯 SUMMARY: UNIVERSAL RULES TO APPLY EVERYWHERE
Top 10 Non-Negotiables:

Every number > 20pt, every label < 15pt (hierarchy through scale)
Every interaction has animation (200-400ms, spring physics)
Every tap has haptic feedback (light/medium/heavy based on importance)
Every card has shadow (minimum 2pt blur, 8% opacity)
Every color has meaning (semantic palette, no random colors)
Every empty state has illustration + CTA (never just "0" or "None")
Every loading state shows skeleton (never blank screen or spinner alone)
Every success has celebration (checkmark + haptic + optional confetti)
Every metric has context (trend arrow, comparison, or goal progress)
Every screen has one primary action (visually dominant CTA button)

Week 1-2: Foundation

Typography scale
Color system
Spacing grid
Shadow/depth system
Empty state illustrations

Week 3-4: Motion

This system transforms DailyFitness from a functional app into an experience that users crave. Every detail reinforces the feeling: "I'm getting stronger, and this app celebrates that with me."RetryHWhat about the background or app theme or i don’t really know how to call it but some app have that and it feels nice and smooth and modern, does this makes any sense?YES! You're talking about Visual Atmosphere & Design Language
You're describing something subtle but incredibly powerful - the overall aesthetic mood that makes an app feel cohesive, premium, and distinct. Let me break down what creates that "smooth and modern" feeling.

🎨 WHAT YOU'RE SENSING: The "Vibe" Layer
It's a combination of:

Background treatment (textures, gradients, blur effects)
Glass morphism (frosted glass effects)
Neumorphism (soft shadows, subtle depth)
Gradient overlays (atmospheric color washes)
Particle effects (subtle animations in background)
Lighting effects (how light "hits" elements)
Material consistency (everything feels like it's made of the same "stuff")

Let me show you what top apps do and how to apply it to DailyFitness:

📱 EXAMPLES: Apps with Strong Visual Atmosphere
Apple Fitness+ / iOS Health App
What they do:

Soft gradient backgrounds that change by time of day
Frosted glass cards (blur effect showing background through)
Subtle animated patterns in background (moving dots, waves)
Lighting effect: Everything looks backlit and glowing
Color shifts based on activity type

  #FFE8F5 33%   (Pink to lavender)
  #E8E8FF 66%   (Lavender to blue)
  #E8F5FF 100%  (Light blue)

Afternoon (12pm-6pm):
  Linear gradient 180deg:
  #FFF4E8 0%    (Warm cream)
  #FFEDE8 33%   (Peach)
  #FFE8ED 66%   (Rose)
  #F5E8FF 100%  (Light purple)

Evening (6pm-10pm):
  Linear gradient 180deg:
  #E8EEFF 0%    (Twilight blue)

Card Treatment:
- Background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85)
- Backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%)
- Border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.18)
- Shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)
- This creates "frosted glass" effect

Particles (Optional):
- Tiny white/colored dots (2-4px)
- Randomly placed, slowly float up
- Opacity: 10-30%
- Speed: 20-40 seconds to cross screen
- Fade in/out at edges

    #E8F5FF 100%
  );
  background-size: 100% 200%;
  animation: gradientShift 10s ease-in-out infinite;
}

@keyframes gradientShift {
  0%, 100% { background-position: 0% 50%; }
  50% { background-position: 0% 100%; }
}

  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.18);
  border-radius: 16px;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
}

/* Particle Container */
.particles {
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
  pointer-events: none;
}

.particle {
  position: absolute;
  width: 3px;
  height: 3px;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);
  border-radius: 50%;
  animation: float 30s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes float {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(100vh) translateX(0);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  10% {
    opacity: 0.3;
  }
  90% {
    opacity: 0.3;
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateY(-10vh) translateX(10vw);
    opacity: 0;

### **OPTION 3: "MINIMAL ELEVATED" (Clean Alternative)**
*Inspired by: Apple Health, Things 3, Clear app*
*Vibe: Clean, sophisticated, minimal*
```
VISUAL SYSTEM:

Background:
- Solid, clean color (not gradient)
- Subtle variations for depth

Light Mode:
- Primary: #F5F7FA (Cool gray-blue)
- Elevated: #FAFBFC (Slightly lighter)
- Sunken: #E8ECEF (Slightly darker)

Dark Mode:
- Primary: #000000 (True black - OLED)
- Elevated: #1C1C1E (Barely lighter)
- Sunken: #0A0A0A (Barely darker)

Card Treatment:
- Cards "float" with strong shadows
- Multiple shadow layers for depth:
  
  Shadow Layer 1 (Ambient):
  0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04)
  
  Shadow Layer 2 (Direct):
  0 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)
  
  Shadow Layer 3 (Depth):
  0 16px 48px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)
  
- Combined creates realistic elevation
- Cards look like paper floating above surface

Accent Elements:
- Colored bars/indicators only
- Everything else is grayscale
- Color used VERY sparingly
- When color appears, it's impactful

Divider Lines:
- Hairline dividers (0.5px)
- Subtle: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)
- Creates sections without clutter

Typography:
- System fonts only (SF Pro)
- Hierarchy through size & weight
- LOTS of whitespace
- Breathable, not cramped
```

🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
Step 1: Create the Gradient Background
jsx// React Native Implementation
import { LinearGradient } from 'expo-linear-gradient';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function AppBackground() {
  const [gradientColors, setGradientColors] = useState(getMorningColors());
  
  function getMorningColors() {
    return ['#FFE8E8', '#FFE8F5', '#E8E8FF', '#E8F5FF'];
  }
  
  function getAfternoonColors() {
    return ['#FFF4E8', '#FFEDE8', '#FFE8ED', '#F5E8FF'];
  }
  
  function getEveningColors() {
    return ['#E8EEFF', '#EEE8FF', '#FFE8F8', '#FFE8F8'];
  }
  
  function getNightColors() {
    return ['#1C1C2E', '#2E1C2E', '#2E2E1C', '#1C1C2E'];
  }
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const hour = new Date().getHours();
    
    if (hour >= 5 && hour < 12) {
      setGradientColors(getMorningColors());
    } else if (hour >= 12 && hour < 18) {
      setGradientColors(getAfternoonColors());
    } else if (hour >= 18 && hour < 22) {
      setGradientColors(getEveningColors());
    } else {
      setGradientColors(getNightColors());
    }
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <LinearGradient
      colors={gradientColors}
      style={styles.background}
      start={{ x: 0, y: 0 }}
      end={{ x: 0, y: 1 }}
    />
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  background: {
    position: 'absolute',
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
    top: 0,
    bottom: 0,
  }
});
Step 2: Create Frosted Glass Cards
jsx// React Native with Blur
import { BlurView } from 'expo-blur';

function GlassCard({ children }) {
  return (
    <BlurView
      intensity={20}
      tint="light"
      style={styles.glassCard}
    >
      <View style={styles.cardContent}>
        {children}
      </View>
    </BlurView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  glassCard: {
    borderRadius: 16,
    overflow: 'hidden',
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.18)',
    shadowColor: '#000',
    shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 8 },
    shadowOpacity: 0.08,
    shadowRadius: 32,
    elevation: 8, // Android
  },
  cardContent: {
    padding: 20,
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.65)',
  }
});
Step 3: Add Floating Particles (Optional)
jsximport { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { Animated, View, Dimensions } from 'react-native';

function FloatingParticles({ count = 15 }) {
  const particles = useRef(
    Array(count).fill(0).map(() => ({
      translateY: new Animated.Value(Dimensions.get('window').height),
      translateX: new Animated.Value(Math.random() * Dimensions.get('window').width),
      opacity: new Animated.Value(0),
    }))
  ).current;
  
  useEffect(() => {
    particles.forEach((particle, index) => {
      // Stagger start times
      setTimeout(() => {
        animateParticle(particle);
      }, index * 2000);
    });
  }, []);
  
  function animateParticle(particle) {
    particle.translateY.setValue(Dimensions.get('window').height);
    particle.opacity.setValue(0);
    
    Animated.parallel([
      Animated.timing(particle.translateY, {
        toValue: -50,
        duration: 30000,
        useNativeDriver: true,
      }),
      Animated.sequence([
        Animated.timing(particle.opacity, {
          toValue: 0.3,
          duration: 3000,
          useNativeDriver: true,
        }),
        Animated.timing(particle.opacity, {
          toValue: 0.3,
          duration: 24000,
          useNativeDriver: true,
        }),
        Animated.timing(particle.opacity, {
          toValue: 0,
          duration: 3000,
          useNativeDriver: true,
        }),
      ])
    ]).start(() => {
      // Loop
      animateParticle(particle);
    });
  }
  
  return (
    <View style={styles.particlesContainer} pointerEvents="none">
      {particles.map((particle, index) => (
        <Animated.View
          key={index}
          style={[
            styles.particle,
            {
              transform: [
                { translateY: particle.translateY },
                { translateX: particle.translateX },
              ],
              opacity: particle.opacity,
            }
          ]}
        />
      ))}
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  particlesContainer: {
    position: 'absolute',
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
    top: 0,
    bottom: 0,
  },
  particle: {
    position: 'absolute',
    width: 3,
    height: 3,
    borderRadius: 1.5,
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4)',
  }
});

🎨 PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
Your app structure should be:
jsxfunction App() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      {/* Background Layer */}
      <AppBackground />
      
      {/* Floating Particles (Optional) */}
      <FloatingParticles count={15} />
      
      {/* Content Layer */}
      <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <ScrollView>
          {/* All your content in glass cards */}
          <GlassCard>
            <Text>Good morning! 👋</Text>
            <Text>8 day streak</Text>
          </GlassCard>
          
          <GlassCard>
            <Text>Today's Workout</Text>
          </GlassCard>
          
          {/* etc */}
        </ScrollView>
      </SafeAreaView>
    </View>
  );
}
```

## ⚡ PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

**Important:** This looks beautiful but can impact performance if not done right.
```
OPTIMIZATION CHECKLIST:

✅ Use native drivers for animations
✅ Limit particles to 15-20 max
✅ Use simple gradients (2-4 colors)
✅ Avoid complex blur on Android (use semi-transparent instead)
✅ Cache gradient calculations
✅ Reduce blur intensity on older devices
✅ Provide "reduce motion" option in settings
✅ Test on actual devices (not just simulator)

## 🌓 DARK MODE ADAPTATION

Your gradient system should shift for dark mode:
```
DARK MODE GRADIENTS:

Dashboard/Home (Dark):
Linear gradient 180deg:
#1A1A2E 0%    (Deep navy)
#16213E 33%   (Navy blue)
#0F3460 66%   (Ocean blue)
#1A1A2E 100%  (Deep navy)

Intensity Variation:
- Workout screens: Darker, more focused
- Progress screens: Lighter, more uplifting
- Rest/Recovery: Coolest tones

Glass Cards (Dark):
- Background: rgba(28, 28, 30, 0.80)
- Backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(150%)
- Border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)
- Shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)

Particles (Dark):
- Slightly brighter: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)
- More visible against dark background
- Can add slight color tint (blue/purple)

🎯 THE RESULT
With this visual atmosphere, DailyFitness will feel:

✨ Premium - frosted glass = high-end
🌊 Alive - gradients and particles create movement
🎨 Modern - matches current design trends (2024-2025)
💪 Energetic - colors and motion suggest activity
🧘 Calm - subtle enough for daily use
🎮 Immersive - feels like an experience, not a tool

The key is subtlety - users shouldn't consciously notice these effects, but they should feel the difference. It's like the difference between a room with good lighting vs. bad lighting - you might not know why, but one just feels better.
