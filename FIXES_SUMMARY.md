## 📊 Category System Explained

### You Now Have TWO Category Systems (This is Good!)

#### 1. **Workout Categories**

- **URL**: `/coach/categories`
- **Purpose**: Organize workout templates and programs
- **Table**: `workout_categories`
- **Examples**: "Upper Body Day", "Leg Day", "Full Body", "HIIT Session"
- **Used by**: Workouts and Programs

#### 2. **Exercise Categories** ⭐ NEW

- **URL**: `/coach/exercise-categories`
- **Purpose**: Organize individual exercises
- **Table**: `exercise_categories`
- **Examples**: "Strength", "Cardio", "Flexibility", "Balance", "Rehabilitation"
- **Used by**: Individual exercises only

### Why Separate?

Think of it like this:

- **Exercise Categories** = Type of movement (Strength, Cardio, etc.)
- **Workout Categories** = Type of workout session (Upper Body, Leg Day, etc.)

Example:

- Exercise: "Bench Press" → Exercise Category: "Strength"
- Workout: "Upper Body Blast" → Workout Category: "Upper Body Day"
- The workout can contain exercises from multiple exercise categories!
