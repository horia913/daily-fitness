# Evidence-Based Training Volume and Intensity Recommendations for Fitness App

## 1. HYPERTROPHY TRAINING

### Weekly Volume (Sets per Muscle Group per Week)

**Minimum Effective Dose:**
- 4 sets per muscle group per week (Pelland et al., 2024)
- Produces measurable hypertrophy gains for maintenance

**Optimal Range:**
- 10-20 sets per muscle group per week (Schoenfeld et al., 2017; Baz-Valle et al., 2022)
- Most research supports this as the "sweet spot" for trained individuals
- Diminishing returns begin after ~20 sets/week

**Advanced/High Volume:**
- 20+ sets per muscle group per week
- May benefit some individuals with high recovery capacity
- No clear advantage over moderate volume (12-20 sets) for most muscle groups
- Risk of impaired recovery increases

**Per-Session Volume:**
- 6-8 hard sets per muscle group per session appears optimal
- Point of undetectable superiority at ~11 sets per session (Remmert et al., 2024)
- Distribute weekly volume across 2-3 sessions per muscle group

**References:**
- Pelland et al. (2024) - Meta-regression on weekly volume
- Schoenfeld et al. (2017) - Dose-response relationship meta-analysis
- Baz-Valle et al. (2022) - Systematic review on training volumes
- Remmert et al. (2024) - Per-session volume meta-analysis

### Load and Intensity (% 1RM correlated with RIR)

**RIR-Based Intensity Guide:**

| Rep Range | % 1RM Range | RIR Target | Training Goal |
|-----------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 6-8 | 80-87% | 1-3 | Strength-Hypertrophy |
| 8-12 | 70-80% | 2-4 | Hypertrophy |
| 12-15 | 65-75% | 2-4 | Hypertrophy-Endurance |
| 15-20 | 60-70% | 1-3 | Muscular Endurance |

**Key Points:**
- RIR of 0-4 produces similar hypertrophy when volume is equated (Robinson et al., 2024)
- Most sets should be 2-4 RIR for optimal hypertrophy with manageable fatigue
- Occasional sets to 0-1 RIR (especially on isolation exercises)
- Experienced lifters are more accurate at gauging RIR (Zourdos et al., 2016)

**Progression Guidelines:**
- Beginners: Start with 3-4 RIR, focus on form
- Intermediate: 2-3 RIR for most sets
- Advanced: 1-3 RIR, periodically 0-1 RIR on key movements

**References:**
- Robinson et al. (2024) - RIR and hypertrophy meta-regression
- Zourdos et al. (2016) - RIR accuracy in trained vs novice lifters
- Helms et al. (2016) - Application of RIR-based RPE scale

---

## 2. STRENGTH TRAINING

### Weekly Volume (Sets per Muscle Group per Week)

**Minimum Effective Dose:**
- 1 set per muscle group per week for strength maintenance (Pelland et al., 2024)
- Significantly lower than hypertrophy requirements

**Optimal Range:**
- 4-5 sets per muscle group per week (Pelland et al., 2024)
- Strength gains plateau beyond ~5 sets/week
- Focus on specificity over volume for strength

**Key Differences from Hypertrophy:**
- Strength is more about intensity and specificity than volume
- Diminishing returns occur much earlier (4-5 sets vs 12-20 for hypertrophy)
- Neural adaptations drive strength more than muscle size

**References:**
- Pelland et al. (2024) - Weekly volume meta-regression for strength
- Ralston et al. (2017) - Strength gain meta-analysis

### Load and Intensity for Strength

**Percentage-Based Guidelines:**

| Rep Range | % 1RM | RIR | Training Focus |
|-----------|-------|-----|----------------|
| 1-3 | 90-100% | 0-2 | Maximal Strength |
| 3-5 | 85-92% | 1-2 | Strength |
| 5-8 | 80-87% | 1-3 | Strength-Hypertrophy |

**Frequency:**
- 2-3 sessions per week per movement pattern
- Higher frequency allows more practice at heavy loads
- Rest 48-72 hours between heavy sessions

**Progression Strategy:**
- Week 1-2: 5x5 at 1-2 RIR
- Week 3-4: Decrease volume, increase intensity
- Week 5-6: Peak with lower reps (1-3), heavier loads
- Deload week 7

- **Moderate Volume:** 900-1,200 contacts per week (780-1,560 jumps)
  - Optimal for most athletes
  - 2 sessions/week: 60-120 jumps per session
  
- **High Volume:** >1,200 contacts per week
  - Only for advanced athletes

## 4. SPRINT SPEED DEVELOPMENT

### Volume and Frequency

**Weekly Sprint Volume:**
- **Beginners:** 600-900 meters total sprint volume
  - 2 sessions/week
  - Example: 2 sets of 6x30m = 360m per session
  
- **Intermediate:** 900-1,500 meters total
  - 2-3 sessions/week
  - Example: 3 sets of 6x30m = 540m per session
  
- **Advanced:** 1,200-2,000 meters total
  - 2-3 sessions/week
  - Higher intensity compensates for less volume

**Session Structure:**
- Rest intervals: 30-60 seconds between reps
- Rest between sets: 3-4 minutes
- Training duration: 6-8 weeks minimum for adaptations

**References:**
- Thurlow et al. (2024) - Repeated sprint training meta-analysis

### Sprint Training Modalities

**Acceleration Development (0-30m):**
- Short sprints: 10-30 meters
- Focus on first 5-10 steps
- 6-10 repetitions per session
- Full recovery (walk back to start)

**Maximum Velocity Development (30m+):**
- Flying sprints: 30-50 meter "fly zones" with 20m build-up
- Build to 95-100% effort
- 4-6 repetitions per session
- 3-5 minutes rest between reps

**Resisted Sprint Training:**
- Light load: 10-20% body mass or <10% velocity decrement

## 5. HEART RATE ZONE TRAINING (Endurance/Cardiovascular)

### Zone Structure (5-Zone Model)

**Zone 1: Recovery/Active Recovery**
- Intensity: 50-60% of HR max
- RPE: 2-3/10
- Purpose: Recovery, warmup, cooldown
- Duration: No limit, promotes blood flow

**Zone 2: Aerobic Base/Endurance**
- Intensity: 60-75% of HR max (or 70-80% of LTHR)
- RPE: 3-5/10
- Purpose: Build aerobic capacity, fat oxidation, mitochondrial density
- Duration: Can sustain for 2+ hours
- **KEY ZONE:** Should constitute 75-90% of total training volume

**Zone 3: Tempo/Threshold**
- Intensity: 75-85% of HR max
- RPE: 6-7/10
- Purpose: Lactate threshold development
- Duration: 10-20 minute intervals
- **CAUTION:** The "grey zone" - avoid spending too much time here
- Can lead to fatigue without maximizing aerobic or anaerobic gains

**Zone 4: Lactate Threshold/Hard**
- Intensity: 85-92% of HR max
- RPE: 7-8/10
- Purpose: Increase lactate threshold, improve speed endurance
- Duration: 3-10 minute intervals with 1-2 minute recovery
- Very challenging but highly effective

**Zone 5: VO2 Max/Maximum**
- Intensity: 92-100% of HR max
- RPE: 9-10/10
- Purpose: Increase VO2 max, anaerobic capacity, maximum power
- Duration: 30 seconds to 3 minutes
- Recovery: Equal or greater than work interval
- Use sparingly (<5% of total volume)

**References:**
- Seiler & Tonnessen (2009) - Training intensity distribution in elite athletes
- Stöggl & Sperlich (2014) - Polarized vs threshold training

### Training Distribution Models

**Polarized Training Model (Recommended for Endurance Athletes):**
- Zone 1-2: 75-80% of total training time
- Zone 3: <5-10% (minimize time in grey zone)
- Zone 4-5: 15-20% of total training time
- Research shows superior results vs threshold-focused training

**Pyramidal Model (Alternative):**
- Zone 1-2: 75-85%
- Zone 3: 10-15%
- Zone 4-5: 5-10%
- More gradual intensity distribution

**Session Frequency by Zone:**
- Zone 2 (easy): 3-6 sessions per week
- Zone 4-5 (high intensity): 2-3 sessions per week maximum
- Allow 48 hours between high-intensity sessions

**References:**
- Stöggl & Sperlich (2014) - Polarized vs pyramidal training
- Seiler (2010) - What is best practice for training intensity?

### Calculating Personal Heart Rate Zones

**Methods:**

1. **Percentage of Maximum Heart Rate:**
   - Max HR = 220 - Age (rough estimate)
   - Better: Field test (all-out 3-5 min effort)
   
2. **Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR):**
   - Perform 30-minute time trial at maximal sustained effort
   - Average HR from final 20 minutes = LTHR
   - More accurate for trained athletes
   
3. **Heart Rate Reserve (Karvonen Method):**
   - Target HR = ((Max HR - Resting HR) × %Intensity) + Resting HR
   - Accounts for fitness level

**Sport-Specific Considerations:**
- Running HR zones typically 5-8 bpm higher than cycling
- Swimming HR zones 10-15 bpm lower than running
- Create separate zones for different modalities if cross-training

## 6. PROGRESSION RULES FOR APP IMPLEMENTATION

### Progressive Overload Principles

**Volume Progression:**
- Increase volume by 10-20% per week maximum
- Every 4th week: deload (reduce volume by 30-50%)
- Prioritize volume increases before intensity increases

**Intensity Progression:**
- Hypertrophy: Add weight when RIR decreases by 1-2 (e.g., 3 RIR becomes 1 RIR)
- Strength: Progress when all sets completed at target RIR
- Use micro-loading (0.5-1kg increases) for upper body, 2.5-5kg for lower body

**Frequency Progression:**
- Beginners: 2-3 sessions per week
- Intermediate: 3-5 sessions per week
- Advanced: 4-6 sessions per week
- Ensure adequate recovery between sessions

### Autoregulation Strategies

**RIR-Based Autoregulation:**
- If RIR feels 2+ higher than target: increase weight 5-10%
- If unable to hit target RIR: reduce weight 5-10%
- Track RIR across weeks to gauge progress

**Velocity-Based Training (VBT) Integration:**
- Can correlate RIR with bar velocity
- Velocity drop of 20-30% indicates nearing failure
- Useful for power training (maintain >0.5 m/s for power)

**Session RPE:**
- Rate overall session difficulty (1-10)
- If consistently >8: reduce volume or intensity
- If consistently <5: increase training stimulus

### Periodization Models

**Linear Periodization (Beginners):**
- Week 1-4: Hypertrophy focus (8-12 reps, 2-3 RIR)
- Week 5-8: Strength focus (4-6 reps, 1-2 RIR)  
- Week 9-10: Power/taper (1-3 reps, 1-2 RIR)
- Week 11: Deload

**Daily Undulating Periodization (Intermediate/Advanced):**
- Day 1: Hypertrophy (8-12 reps, 70-80% 1RM)
- Day 2: Strength (3-5 reps, 85-90% 1RM)
- Day 3: Power (1-3 reps, 90-95% 1RM)
- Rotate throughout week

**Block Periodization (Advanced):**
- Block 1 (4-6 weeks): Accumulation (volume emphasis, moderate intensity)
- Block 2 (3-4 weeks): Intensification (reduced volume, high intensity)
- Block 3 (2-3 weeks): Realization (low volume, peak intensity)
- Block 4 (1 week): Deload

## 7. POPULATION-SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS

### Beginners (0-1 year training)
- Start at minimum effective dose
- Focus on technical mastery over volume
- Hypertrophy: 6-10 sets per muscle per week
- Strength: 2-3 sets per exercise
- Progress slowly (5-10% volume increases)

### Intermediate (1-3 years training)
- Hypertrophy: 10-15 sets per muscle per week
- Can handle moderate RIR (2-3)
- Introduce periodization
- 3-5 training days per week

### Advanced (3+ years training)
- Hypertrophy: 15-20+ sets per muscle per week
- Can train with 1-2 RIR regularly
- Require more sophisticated programming
- 4-6 training days per week
- Individual variation increases (monitor recovery)

### Age Considerations

**Youth (<18 years):**
- Lower volume (10-12 sets per muscle per week)
- Moderate intensity (2-4 RIR)
- Focus on technical proficiency
- 2-3 sessions per week

**Older Adults (>50 years):**
- May require more recovery time
- Moderate volume (8-15 sets per muscle per week)
- Higher frequency, lower volume per session
- Focus on movement quality and injury prevention

## 8. RECOVERY AND FATIGUE MANAGEMENT

### Recovery Guidelines

**Between Sessions:**
- Same muscle group: 48-72 hours
- Heavy CNS-demanding work: 48-72 hours
- Light cardio/active recovery: Can be daily

**Deload Protocols:**
- Every 4-6 weeks reduce volume by 40-50%
- Maintain intensity (same weight, fewer sets)
- Or reduce intensity (lighter weight, same sets)
- Duration: 1 week

**Signs of Overtraining:**
- Persistent high RHR (>5-10 bpm above baseline)
- Decreased performance across sessions
- Mood disturbances, poor sleep
- Action: Immediate deload or rest week

### Recovery Metrics to Track

**Subjective:**
- Sleep quality (1-10 scale)
- Muscle soreness (1-10 scale)
- Energy levels (1-10 scale)
- Motivation (1-10 scale)

**Objective:**
- Resting heart rate (track trends)
- Heart rate variability (HRV)
- Session RPE
- Performance metrics (weights lifted, times)

## 9. INTEGRATING INTO WORKOUT TEMPLATES

### Template Structure Recommendations

**Session-Level:**
```
1. Warm-up
   - 5-10 min Zone 1-2 cardio
   - Dynamic stretching
   - Mobility work

2. Main Work
   - Compound movements first (strength/power)
   - Isolation work second (hypertrophy)
   - Track sets, reps, RIR, load

3. Accessory/Finisher
   - Corrective exercises
   - Conditioning work
   - Core work

4. Cool-down
   - 5-10 min Zone 1 work
   - Static stretching
```

**Weekly Template:**
- Allow users to set goals (hypertrophy/strength/power/endurance)
- Auto-calculate weekly volumes based on goal and experience level
- Distribute volume across user's available training days
- Include built-in deload weeks

**Progression Tracking:**
- Log RIR for each set
- Calculate estimated 1RM from top sets
- Track volume load (sets × reps × weight)
- Display trends over time
- Alert if volume increases >20% per week

**Smart Notifications:**
- "Consider deload week - 5 weeks of progressive training completed"
- "RIR consistently low - consider weight increase"
- "Resting HR elevated - consider extra rest day"

### Program Creation Logic

**Input Variables:**
- Training experience (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- Primary goal (hypertrophy/strength/power/endurance)
- Available training days per week
- Current 1RM or RIR data
- Equipment available

**Auto-Generated Recommendations:**
- Calculate appropriate weekly volume
- Suggest appropriate intensity (% 1RM or RIR targets)
- Propose training split based on frequency
- Schedule high-intensity and low-intensity work
- Include appropriate deload frequency

**Example Logic:**
```
IF goal = hypertrophy AND experience = intermediate THEN
  weekly_sets_per_muscle = 12-15
  intensity_range = 70-80% 1RM
  RIR_target = 2-3
  frequency = 4-5 days/week
  deload_every = 4 weeks
```
