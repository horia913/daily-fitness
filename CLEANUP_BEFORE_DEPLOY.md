# Cleanup Before Deploy - Optional

## Features to Remove (Not Using)

### 1. In-App Messaging

Since you're not using in-app messaging, you can optionally remove these:

**Files/Folders:**

- `src/app/coach/messages/`
- `src/app/client/messages/`

**Menu Items to Remove:**
In navigation components, remove message-related items.

**Impact**: None - feature not being used anyway

---

### 2. Payment Processing

Since you're not using in-app purchases:

**Database Tables (can ignore):**

- `payments` table
- `session_bookings.payment_status` (if not doing paid sessions)

**Impact**: None - just unused schema

---

## OR: Keep Everything for Future Use

**Recommendation**: **KEEP EVERYTHING** for now!

### Why?

- Code is already there and working
- Not hurting anything
- Future flexibility
- You might want messaging/payments later
- Easy to remove later if needed

**Better to deploy with extra features than remove them now.**

---

## What You SHOULD Do Now

### 1. Run Required SQL Scripts ‚ö†Ô∏è MUST DO

In Supabase SQL Editor, run these 2 scripts:

**Script 1**: `CREATE_EXERCISE_ALTERNATIVES_TABLE.sql`

```sql
-- Creates exercise_alternatives table
-- Enables exercise swap functionality
```

**Script 2**: `FIX_EXERCISE_CATEGORIES_RLS.sql`

```sql
-- Fixes RLS policies for exercise categories
-- Allows coaches to create/edit categories
```

### 2. Test Core Features (10 minutes)

**Coach Flow:**

- [ ] Sign in
- [ ] Create exercise category
- [ ] Create exercise (with checkboxes)
- [ ] Add exercise alternatives
- [ ] Create workout
- [ ] Assign workout to client

**Client Flow:**

- [ ] Sign in
- [ ] View assigned workout
- [ ] Start workout
- [ ] Complete workout

### 3. Build Test (2 minutes)

```bash
npm run build
```

Should say: "‚úì Finished writing to disk"

### 4. Deploy! üöÄ

Follow `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

## Post-Deployment (Anytime)

### Things You Can Add Later:

- ‚è∞ Email notifications (password reset, workout assigned, etc.)
- ‚è∞ Push notifications (workout reminders)
- ‚è∞ In-app messaging (if you change your mind)

- ‚è∞ Improve error messages
- ‚è∞ Add more animations
- ‚è∞ Polish edge cases
