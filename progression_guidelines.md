**Notes on Progression:**
- Volume = total sets OR total reps OR total distance/contacts depending on category
- Intensity = load % OR effort level (for cardio)
- Never increase volume AND intensity simultaneously
- Deload = reduce volume by specified % while maintaining intensity, OR reduce intensity while maintaining volume
- "Progress When" = criteria for adding load/volume/difficulty

## Table 7: Micro-Cycle Progression (Within-Week Variation)

| Category | Difficulty | Session 1 Volume (% of weekly target) | Session 1 Intensity | Session 2 Volume (% of weekly target) | Session 2 Intensity | Session 3 Volume (% of weekly target) | Session 3 Intensity |
|----------|-----------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Hypertrophy | Beginner | 50 | Moderate | 50 | Moderate | N/A | N/A |
| Hypertrophy | Intermediate | 35 | Moderate | 35 | High | 30 | Low-Moderate |
| Hypertrophy | Advanced | 30 | High | 35 | Moderate | 35 | Moderate-High |
| Hypertrophy | Athlete | 25 | High | 30 | Moderate | 25 | High | 
| Max Strength | Beginner | 50 | Moderate | 50 | Moderate | N/A | N/A |
| Max Strength | Intermediate | 50 | Heavy | 50 | Moderate-Heavy | N/A | N/A |
| Max Strength | Advanced | 40 | Heavy | 30 | Moderate | 30 | Very Heavy |
| Max Strength | Athlete | 35 | Very Heavy | 35 | Moderate | 30 | Heavy |
| Explosive Power | All | 50 | Max Effort | 50 | Max Effort | N/A | N/A |
| Sprint Speed | All | 50 | Max Effort | 50 | Max Effort | N/A | N/A |

**Notes:**
- % of weekly target refers to sets OR ground contacts OR sprint volume
- Intensity descriptors: Low (4-5 RIR), Moderate (2-3 RIR), High (1-2 RIR), Very Heavy (0-1 RIR), Max Effort (explosive/sprint work)
- For 4+ session weeks, distribute volume more evenly with varying intensities
- Always separate high-intensity sessions by 48+ hours

## Table 8: Periodization Block Recommendations (4-12 Week Programs)

| Program Duration (weeks) | Block 1 Name | Block 1 Duration (weeks) | Block 1 Focus | Block 2 Name | Block 2 Duration (weeks) | Block 2 Focus | Block 3 Name | Block 3 Duration (weeks) | Block 3 Focus |
|------------------------|------------|----------------------|-------------|------------|----------------------|-------------|------------|----------------------|-------------|
| 4 | Accumulation | 3 | Volume | Deload | 1 | Recovery | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 6 | Accumulation | 4 | Volume | Intensification | 1 | Intensity | Deload | 1 | Recovery |
| 8 | Accumulation | 5 | Volume | Intensification | 2 | Intensity | Deload | 1 | Recovery |
| 10 | Accumulation | 6 | Volume | Intensification | 3 | Intensity | Deload | 1 | Recovery |
| 12 | Accumulation | 6 | Volume | Intensification | 4 | Intensity | Realization | 1 | Peak |

**Block Characteristics:**

| Block Type | Volume Level | Intensity Level | RIR Target | Primary Goal |
|-----------|------------|---------------|----------|------------|
| Accumulation | High (near max recommended) | Moderate (70-80% 1RM) | 2-4 | Build work capacity, hypertrophy |
| Intensification | Reduced (60-70% of accumulation) | High (80-90% 1RM) | 1-2 | Increase strength, power |
| Realization/Peak | Low (40-50% of accumulation) | Very High (90-100% 1RM) | 0-1 | Competition prep, testing |
| Deload | 40-60% of previous block | Maintain OR reduce | Same or higher | Recovery, adaptation |

## Table 9: Recovery & Fatigue Indicators

| Indicator | Optimal Range | Yellow Flag | Red Flag | Action if Red Flag |
|-----------|-------------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| Resting Heart Rate (bpm above baseline) | 0-3 | 4-7 | 8+ | Immediate deload or rest day |
| Sleep Quality (1-10 scale) | 7-10 | 5-6 | <5 | Reduce volume 20-30% |
| Muscle Soreness (1-10 scale) | 1-4 | 5-6 | 7+ | Extra rest day, reduce volume |
| Energy Levels (1-10 scale) | 7-10 | 5-6 | <5 | Light session or rest |
| Motivation (1-10 scale) | 7-10 | 5-6 | <5 | Deload week or change stimulus |
| Session RPE (1-10 scale) | 6-8 | 8-9 | 9-10 sustained | Reduce volume or intensity |
| Performance Trend | Improving or stable | Stagnant 2+ weeks | Decreasing | Deload immediately |
| RIR Accuracy (Target vs Actual) | Within 1 | Off by 2 | Off by 3+ | Adjust loads, possible fatigue |

**Monitoring Recommendations:**
- Track RHR daily upon waking
- Log subjective metrics (sleep, soreness, energy, motivation) daily
- Calculate session RPE 15-30 min post-workout
- Review trends weekly
- If 2+ red flags appear: immediate intervention needed
